# build-webos

This repository contains the top level code that aggregates the various [OpenEmbedded](http://openembedded.org) layers into a whole from which [webOS Open Source Edition (OSE)](https://www.webosose.org/) images can be built.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you prepare the target device and systems that meet the [System Requirements](https://www.webosose.org/docs/guides/setup/system-requirements/).

## How to Build a webOS OSE Image

$ cd build-webos
$ git checkout -t origin/<branch of the latest webOS OSE version>

# Install and configure the build
$ sudo scripts/prerequisites.sh
